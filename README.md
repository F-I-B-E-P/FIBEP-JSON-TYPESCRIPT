# FIBEP JSON Typescript

The Project contains utilities for Decoding, Encoding and Validating the FIBEP JSON Standard

## Getting Started

To quickly get started you can easily start a Node JS Server 
which uses the Utilities in several ways.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to use the software

* Node.js

### Run the Node JS Server

* `npm install` for installing project dependencies
* `tsc` for generating Javascript from Typescript
* `cd src/javascript/http` for starting the Server from the Server JS root file so Example File Paths match.
* `node server` for running the Node JS Server with Examples.
